# sudokusolver

Looking for a challenge, I thought of building a web application to solve Sudoku puzzles.
It took a few tries to get the data structure working well.
After applying simple logic to reduce the number of cell possibilities, the application could solve puzzles rated from Easy to Hard.
To solve Expert puzzles I built a brute-force solution to try values until the puzzle was solved.
